# STALL_NUMBER_DETECTION'
In this study, we describe the process of building, fitting,and applying a Convolutional Neural Network for a detec-tion task on images. The purpose of this research is to de-velop a detection system that can identify the number of stalland define the coordinates of number. This is significant be-cause it can have practical implications in various settings,such as parking garages, airports, and other public spaceswhere it is important to keep track of the number of avail-able stalls
